                    <h2>1) Recent studies show that around 70% of coding jobs have nothing to do with technology at all</h2>
                    <p>That’s right, you or your child could learn to program and apply this knowledge to topics completely separate from technology – like nature studies, geography research, and film and design.</p>

                    <h2>2) Computer Programming was instrumental in helping end World War II</h2>
                    <p> Alan Turing was also responsible for helping the allies bring World War II to a close. During the height of the large-scale conflict, he would use his skills to crack the Enigma machine, a cipher utilized by the Nazis to protect their military communications.</p>

                    <p>In the future, coding and technical literacy may be nearly as essential to daily life as literacy is now. The United States has a literacy rate of 99%. Imagine 99% of the population knowing how to code.</p>

                    <h2>4) NASA still operates some projects on programming from the 1970’s</h2>
                    <p>You may be fluent in Javascript or C++ but what NASA engineers really need to know is ADA and HAL/S (or High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle). Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough for almost any application and is used widely across NASA’s projects. Newer projects, such as the International Space Station, operate on a programming language called ADA.</p>
